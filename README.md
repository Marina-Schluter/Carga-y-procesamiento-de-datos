    1.10- Finding duplicate elements
    1.11- Cleaning column names by removing leading spaces
    1.12- Checking for null values
    1.13- Calculating the percentage of null values in each column
    1.14- Dropping columns based on null values
    1.15- Fixing columns
    1.16- Checking a line of the DataFrame before starting the analysis


## Analysis

    2.5- Which anime has the most members? Show it along with its name
    2.6- How many animes have a score greater than 8.0?
    2.7- Which studio has produced the most animes?
    2.8- What distribution do the variables in the "score" column follow?
    2.9- What is the relationship between the score and the number of members?
    2.10- Is there a correlation between the score and the number of members?
    2.11- How many animes have matching names (name) and Japanese names (title_japanese)? What are those animes?
    2.12- What is the average duration of the Top5 most popular animes?
    2.13- What are the top 3 studios with the most created animes? Sort them in descending order
    2.14- How many movies and how many series are there in the list?
